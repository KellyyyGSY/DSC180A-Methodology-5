## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorm

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I found the application of theoretical models to stock price analysis particularly compelling. The process of combining mathematical rigor with real-world data to make predictions is both challenging and rewarding.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to expand on our Quarter 1 work by developing a robust portfolio management strategy. This would involve identifying alpha (excess returns) in stock prices using advanced models and back-testing these strategies on historical data.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
One change I’d make is to focus more on empirical validation. While our Quarter 1 project emphasized theoretical models, I would like to incorporate more data-driven approaches to test the models' predictive capabilities in real-world scenarios.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I am interested in using machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning, for optimizing portfolio strategies. Additionally, I’d like to explore sentiment analysis of financial news as a factor for stock selection and timing decisions.
